This is a simple shape component of Euclidean geometry, corresponding [THREE.RingGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/geometries/RingGeometry). It is contructed from a number of triangular segments that are oriented around a central point and extend as far out as a given radius. It is built counter-clockwise from a start angle and a given central angle. It can also be used to create regular polygons, where the number of segments determines the number of sides. Properties of [VglGeometry](vgl-geometry) are also available as mixin. 



## props 
- `inner-radius` ***number*** (*optional*) `default: 0.5` 
Inner radius of the ring. 

- `outer-radius` ***number*** (*optional*) `default: 1` 
Outer radius of the ring. 

- `theta-segments` ***number*** (*optional*) `default: 8` 
Number of segments along to the tangential direction. 

- `phi-segments` ***number*** (*optional*) `default: 1` 
Number of segments along to the radial direction. 

- `theta-start` ***number*** (*optional*) 
The starting angle. 

- `theta-length` ***number*** (*optional*) `default: [object Object]` 
The central angle.
