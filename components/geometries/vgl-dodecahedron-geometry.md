A component for generating a dodecahedron geometries,
corresponding [THREE.DodecahedronGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/geometries/DodecahedronGeometry).

Properties of [VglGeometry](vgl-geometry) are also available as mixin. 

## props 

- `radius` ***number*** (*optional*) `default: 1` 

  Radius of the dodecahedron. 

- `detail` ***number*** (*optional*) 

  Setting this to a value greater than 0 adds vertices making it no longer a dodecahedron.
